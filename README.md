# lets-type
Let's Type (2.0) is a silly little chat UI made with the Ruby Curses library.

Let's Type is a fully functional (though not very useful) Ruby app, but this project is actually meant as a foundation for a terminal IRC client made with the basic Sockets and Curses libraries, which I will hopefully continue at some point.
