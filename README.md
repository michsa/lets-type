# lets-type
Let's Type (3.0) is a dumb little chat UI made with the Ruby curses library.

Let's Type is a fully functional (though not very useful) Ruby app, but this project is actually meant as a foundation for a terminal IRC client made with the basic sockets and curses libraries, which I will hopefully continue at some point.

To run, you need Ruby (should work on old and new versions alike), libncurses5-dev (you're probably SOL if you're on Windows), and the Ruby curses library, which was moved to a gemfile in 2.1.
